# Section 4: Water Quality Assessment Program

The WQIP outlines the four major elements of the Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Program:
1. Monitoring to assess progress toward goals and
schedules,
2. Receiving water monitoring program that measures
the long-term health of the WMA during dry and wet
weather conditions,
3. MS4 outfall monitoring program to investigate and
eliminate unauthorized dry weather flows from MS4
outfalls and the improvement in quality of the
discharges from storm drains during wet weather, and
4. Special studies that address data gaps or provide
information to more effectively address pollutants or stressors that cause or contribute to an
HPWQC.
Monitoring information used to assess progress toward goals and schedules is included in each applicable
Goal section of this annual report (Section 3). Tables 11 through 13 provide a list of WQIP monitoring
programs and identify where information for those programs is located. This Annual Report includes
monitoring information collected during the 2022-2023 monitoring year and the respective assessments
required by the MS4 Permit. The 2022-2023 monitoring data is submitted to CEDEN, provided on the
Project Clean Water website (Regional Clearinghouse), and included in individual attachments to this 
report.

>**Wet Weather** is defined as a storm
event of >0.1 inch of rainfall and the
following 72 hours after the end of
rainfall.

>**Dry Weather**  is defined as all days
where the preceding 72 hours have
been without measurable precipitation
(>0.1 inch).


### Table 21: Carlsbad WMA WQIP Special Studies and Additional Investigations Overview
| MS4 Permit Special Study or Investigation | Description | Status & Findings |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------|------------------|
| **San Diego Regional Reference Streams and Beaches Study** (MS4 Permit Special Study) (City of Oceanside, City of Vista, City of San Marcos, City of Escondido, County of San Diego, City of Carlsbad, City of Encinitas, City of Solana Beach) | The study was designed to measure FIB concentrations and loads at streams and beaches minimally disturbed by anthropogenic activities (i.e., representative of “reference” conditions). | **Completed.** Enterococcus appears to be prevalent in environments minimally impacted by human activities. Enterococcus can often exceed the WQO during both dry and wet weather conditions in streams and dry weather in beaches. (Weston and AMEC Foster Wheeler, 2017) |
| **Bight ’13 Microbiology Drainage Water Study in Cottonwood Creek** (MS4 Permit Special Study) (City of Encinitas) | This special study is designed to characterize inputs of human fecal contamination within the Cottonwood Creek drainage subarea, which may be contributing to FIB exceedances at Moonlight Beach. | **Completed.** The study concluded that human fecal pollution is ubiquitous in highly urbanized environments, is highly variable across sites, and the extent in drainage systems expands considerably during wet weather events. |
| **Clean Beaches Initiative Grant – Fecal Indicator Bacteria (FIB) Microbial Source Identification Study for Buccaneer Beach and Loma Alta Creek** (MS4 Permit Special Study) (City of Oceanside) | This special study aimed to perform an initial watershed screening and microbial source identification project. The results were used to identify high-risk conditions to protect public health and implement management strategies to control fecal contamination in the Loma Alta Creek HA. | **Completed.** This research yielded valuable information as a first step toward comprehensively identifying host sources of fecal contamination and transport routes in the Loma Alta Creek watershed. The City continues to seek additional financial resources to initiate “Phase 2” source investigation work to follow this study. If funded, Phase 2 would entail source investigations at outfalls where human source markers (HF183) were detected during the initial study. |
| **Upper San Marcos HA Flow and Water Quality Monitoring** (MS4 Permit Special Study) (City of San Marcos, City of Escondido, County of San Diego) | Wet season continuous flow monitoring and wet weather event monitoring are conducted annually at SM-TWAS-1b. Data is used to calculate nutrient loads to track progress toward interim and final wet weather numeric goals related to nutrients. Dry weather flow monitoring is conducted at SM-TWAS-1a-DS and at the County of San Diego and City of San Marcos jurisdictional outfalls. Data is used to track progress toward interim and final dry weather numeric goals related to nutrients. | **Ongoing.** During the reporting period, the County of San Diego and the City of San Marcos and City of Escondido performed continuous-flow monitoring in the Creek and collected wet weather samples for nutrients and total suspended solids. Monitoring efforts are reported in Attachment 2. and are presented in Section 3.3.2. . |
| **Buena Vista Creek HA Dry Weather Special Study** (Additional Investigation) (City of Carlsbad) | The City of Carlsbad conducted a dry weather special study at three persistently flowing outfalls in the Buena Vista Creek HA. The special study assessed the baseline flow observed, temporal flow patterns, fecal indicator bacteria concentrations, and temporal patterns of fecal indicator bacteria at the persistently flowing MS4 outfalls during dry weather conditions. | **Completed.** The study provided data to address data gaps related to non-storm water flows and applicable pollutant patterns and established baseline flows to measure subsequent flow reductions. |
| **Agua Hedionda HA Dry Weather Special Study** (Additional Investigation) (City of Vista, City of Carlsbad) | The City of Carlsbad conducted a dry weather special study at two persistently flowing outfalls in the Agua Hedionda HA. The special study assessed the baseline flow observed, temporal flow patterns, fecal indicator bacteria concentrations, and temporal patterns of fecal indicator bacteria at the persistently flowing MS4 outfalls during dry weather conditions. | **Completed.** The study provided data to address data gaps related to non-storm water flows and applicable pollutant patterns and established baseline flows to measure subsequent flow reductions. The City of Vista’s dry weather special study was intended to characterize persistent dry weather flows from high priority major MS4 outfalls and establish baseline data from which future monitoring efforts can be compared. The special study and associated data were also intended to guide further investigations of pollutant sources. **Completed.** The study included continuous flow monitoring to assess baseline and temporal flow conditions. Fecal indicator bacteria were also analyzed. |
| **Agua Hedionda Lagoon Special Study (REC-1) – Phase I Monitoring** (Additional Investigation) (City of Vista, City of Carlsbad, County of San Diego) | The Cities of Carlsbad and Vista and the County of San Diego developed a special study with periodic verification monitoring focused on Enterococcus. These efforts can demonstrate that conditions meet REC-1 WQOs and that the Lagoon remains unimpaired per the 303(d) Listing Policy. Consistent with Regional Board Resolution No. R9-2017-0030, supporting the use of Key Beneficial Uses and Key Areas concepts, the special study and verification monitoring will focus on the areas of most importance in the Lagoon and target the Inner Basin where the majority of the REC-1 usage occurs. | **Completed.** Conducted monitoring and assessment of Enterococcus in the lagoon. Actions completed are described in Section 4.1.3 and Appendix D. The complete investigation report was included as Attachment 11 of the FY22 Carlsbad WQIP Annual Report. |
| **Agua Hedionda Lagoon Special Study (SHELL) – Phase I** (Additional Investigation) (City of Vista, City of Carlsbad, County of San Diego) | The Cities of Carlsbad and Vista and the County of San Diego annually evaluate CDPH data to determine whether water quality conditionsin the Outer Basin support commercial shellfish harvesting operations under open conditions. As part of this effort, the RAs may also develop a conceptual model to evaluate potential sources contributing to fecal coliform concentrations in the Outer Basin during the closed condition. | **Completed.** Assessed California Department of Public Health fecal coliform data. Actions completed are described in Section 4.1.3 and Appendix D. |
| **San Marcos HA Dry Weather Special Study** (Additional Investigation) (City of San Marcos, County of San Diego) | City of San Marcos - During September 2016, baseline flow data at the five highest priority persistently flowing major MS4 outfalls were collected along with sampling and analysis for indicator bacteria, nutrient concentrations, water height measurements, and flow volume characterization. | **Completed.** The study identified peak flow trends and identified and abated sources of over-irrigation, resulting in a reduction of dry weather flow compared to 2017 dry season baseline data. The city will continue its patrol program to conduct direct community outreach and implement enforcement where necessary. The County of San Diego’s special study characterized the temporal flows and nutrient and fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) concentrations in dry weather runoff from selected persistently flowing outfalls in the Upper San Marcos HA. **Completed.** The County of San Diego study was conducted during 2016 and 2017 at two major storm drain outfalls that discharge to Lake San Marcos, which drain residential areas within the unincorporated County of San Diego. |
| **Escondido Continuous Flow Special Study** (Additional Investigation) (City of Escondido) | The City of Escondido conducted a continuous flow monitoring special study in 2021 at five priority, persistently flowing outfalls in the Carlsbad WMA to characterize dry weather flow conditions and measure the effectiveness of strategies to reduce or eliminate controllable dry weather sources flows. | **Completed.** The data collected helped identify groundwater flow contributions and target field investigations for successful dry weather flow source observations and eliminations. |
| **Escondido Creek HA Dry Weather Special Study** (Additional Investigation) (City of Escondido, City of Solana Beach) | The City of Escondido installed continuous flow meters at three priority, persistently flowing MS4 outfallsin Escondido Creek HA for approximately two weeks per outfall in 2015. The study's purpose was to assess the volume of dry weather flows, baseline flows, and indications of irrigation runoff patterns orillicit discharges. Samples for indicator bacteria were also collected and analyzed. | **Completed.** Monitoring results suggested that continual dry weather sources (e.g., groundwater source) contributed to dry weather flow at all three sites, and episodic dry weather flow (e.g., irrigation runoff) contributed to dry weather flow at two sites. |
| - | The City of Solana Beach’s special study is intended to characterize persistent dry weather flows from high priority major MS4 outfalls and establish baseline data from which future monitoring efforts can be compared. The special study and associated data may also be used to guide further investigations of pollutant sources. | **Completed.** The study provided data to address data gaps related to non-storm water flows and applicable pollutant patterns and established baseline flows to measure subsequent flow reductions. |
| **Dry Weather MS4 Outfall Flow Source Investigation** (Isotope/Geochemistry Analysis) (Additional Investigation) (County of San Diego) | The County of San Diego’s special study aims to quantify the percentage of imported water in the monitored non-storm water outfall discharges. | **Completed.** The findings showed dry weather flow sources ranging from nearly all imported water to all local groundwater with flows at most sites comprising a mixture of sources. In 2020, the County of San Diego continued flow data collection at most outfall locations monitored in 2018 and 2019. However, due to the COVID-19 social distancing-related restrictions isotope, geochemistry, and indicator analysis were not conducted. |
| **Highest Priority Persistent Flow Outfall Source Identification** (City of Carlsbad) | The study was performed to refine flow source characterization and identify likely sources of flow. | **Completed.** For five highest priority persistent flow outfalls, the study identified likely sources, including groundwater, irrigation runoff and other transient discharges. The report is included as Attachment 6. |
| **Ground Water Study – Dry Weather Flow Source Investigation** (City of Encinitas) | The study was performed to identify and characterize the flow sources at five highest priority persistent flow outfalls. | **Completed.** The study showed that non-storm water flow sources in the city MS4 ranged from nearly all tap water to nearly all groundwater with flows at other sites comprised of a mixture of tap and groundwater. The report is included as Attachment 8. |
| **McClellan-Palomar Airport Water Quality Treatment Facility and Long-Term Effectiveness Monitoring** (Additional Investigation) (County of San Diego) | The study was performed to determine the effectiveness of a water quality treatment facility (installed in 2006) at pollutant removal during low-flow storm events and comply with Proposition 13 Grant requirements. | **Ongoing.** Additional wet weather BMP effectiveness verification monitoring was performed in FY23. Monitoring at the treatment facility demonstrated effective flow attenuation and pollutant load removal for metals, nutrients, and sediment. The FY23 monitoring report is included as Attachment 9. |

>The MS4 Permit defines minimum requirements for special studies: related to HPWQCs, implemented in WMA, and require
some form of participation by all the Copermittees within the WMA. The Carlsbad RAs completed and exceeded the number of
MS4 Permit required special studies. The RAs also perform additional monitoring that are included as special studies. In some
cases, these studies address PWQC and are performed on a jurisdictional level.

## 4.6 Re-Evaluation of Water Quality Conditions

Although receiving water quality conditions do not change substantially from year to year, the RAs may evaluate whether water quality data and findings demonstrate a compelling need to re-evaluate current HPWQCs and PWQCs. In doing so, the RAs may consider:

- Whether water quality improvement outcomes were achieved in MS4 discharges or receiving waters,
- Data, information, and recommendations provided by the public,
- Water quality monitoring collected after initial WQIP development,
- Results from special studies,
- New and developing regulations related to water quality conditions,
- Revised 303(d) listings,
- Basin Plan amendments related to water quality conditions and/or
- RWQCB recommendations.

The RAs re-evaluated water quality conditions in 2019-2020, and as a result, the WQIP was updated. Water quality conditions were not re-evaluated during the FY23 reporting period.
