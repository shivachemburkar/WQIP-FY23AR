# Section 2: Current Water Conditions
## Water Quality Conditions

In the WQIP, Responsible Agencies (RAs) identified Priority Water Quality Conditions (PWQCs) by evaluating receiving water conditions, MS4 discharges and their potential impacts, and potential sources of pollutants in the WMA. The WQIP also details the process the RAs used to identify the Highest Priority Water Quality Conditions (HPWQCs). Tables 2 and 3 list the HA-specific PWQCs and HPWQCs, respectively, per the 2021 WQIP.

**Notes:**

1. **All within WMA** indicates conditions that apply to multiple or all Hydrologic Areas within the WMA.
2. **Nutrients** category includes at least two or more of the following pollutants: Dissolved phosphorus, Orthophosphate, Total phosphorus, Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen, Total Nitrogen, Eutrophication, or Benthic Algae.
3. **SHELL** data were collected by CDPH for the protection of public health related to commercial shellfish harvesting in the Lagoon. CDPH water quality benchmarks are established by the National Shellfish Sanitation Program and exist for fecal coliform only.
4. **REC-1** evaluation involves data for enterococcus only in saline waters (e.g., lagoons, ocean) due to the Bacteria Provisions adopted by the State Water Resources Control Board.
5. **San Marcos Lake** is privately owned by the Citizens Development Corporation.

This table provides a comprehensive breakdown of the priority water quality conditions identified for each hydrologic area within the Carlsbad WMA as per the latest WQIP update.

_Note: The use herein of the terms "pollutant(s)" and "pollution" should not be construed as an admission by the Responsible Agencies that the substances referenced herein constitute "pollutants" as that term is used in the context of liability insurance "pollution" exclusions as construed by California insurance law._
