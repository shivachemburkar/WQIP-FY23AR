# Section 5: Adaptive Management 
## Adaptive Management and Revisions
As part of the adaptive management process, the RAs use information and data acquired from WQIP implementation and water quality monitoring to inform management decisions related to water quality conditions, numeric goals, strategies, and associated schedules. As necessary, RAs may revise the WQIP, respective JRMPs, and/or BMP Design Manuals based upon new data, information, and/or feedback received during the implementation of the WQIP.

Updates and minor modifications to the WQIP, JRMPs, and BMP Design Manuals are presented in this section.
## 5.1 Updates
The adaptive management process may prompt updates to the WQIP and respective JRMPs. Updates to
the WQIP require the collaboration of the RAs and follow, as applicable, a public participation process
similar to that implemented during WQIP development. The public participation process includes
soliciting data and information and consultation with the WQIP Consultation Panel. Updates can be
provided in the WQIP annual reports or the Report of Waste Discharge (ROWD). WQIP updates may
include significant changes to the highest priority water quality conditions, numeric goals, or monitoring
and assessment. BMP Design Manual updates or JRMP updates, such as program modifications and/or
amendments to the JRMPs, are performed as needed by RAs

Updates to the WQIP, respective JRMPs, and BMP Design Manuals during the reporting period are
presented in the following sections.

**Upper San Marcos HA Dry Weather Goals Modifications**

The RAs received a comment letter from RWQCB in May 2021 that included comments regarding the Upper San Marcos HA goals. As part of the FY21 WQIP Annual Report (Appendix B), the RAs submitted response to comments which included analysis of data and the methodology that contributed to a re-evaluation of goals and compliance methods. During the 2021-2022 monitoring year, the County of San Diego and City of San Marcos re-evaluated the dry weather goals and pathways to factor in data and information acquired since the development of the WQIP goals. Using this information, the RAs met with RWQCB staff to coordinate and establish revised dry weather goals and compliance pathways. The WQIP dry weather goals have been updated to reflect the results of the re-evaluation and are provided below (Table 21).

**Table 21: Dry Weather Interim and Final Goals for County of San Diego and City of San Marcos in the Upper San Marcos HA**

### 5.2.2 JRMPs and BMP Design Manuals
**City of Carlsbad**

The City of Carlsbad made minor updates to the city’s JRMP document, including updating the MS4 and Existing Development Maps, Appendices A and B of the JRMP. The city’s JRMP is posted on the city’s website and linked through the Regional Clearinghouse.

**County of San Diego**

The County of San Diego BMP Design Manual (BMP DM) provides guidance for land development and public improvement projects to comply with the 2013 Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) Permit (Order No. R9-2013-0001 as amended by R9-2015-0001 and R9-2015-0100). The County BMP DM remains in compliance with Provisions E.3.a-d, as it has since its February 2016 adoption. Staff had previously coordinated an update to the Model BMP DM with the regional Land Development Workgroup in FY 2018. During FY 2021-2022, the County of San Diego BMP Design Manual was updated to provide clarification on process and requirements. Minor updates were made to Appendix A of the BMP Design Manual. Priority Development Project (PDP) Attachment 10: BMP Installation Verification form and PDP Attachment 11: BMP Maintenance Agreement Plans.

The current BMP DM is available online on the County of San Diego’s website: https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/sdc/dpw/watersheds/DevelopmentandConstruction/BMP_Design_Manual.html -->
