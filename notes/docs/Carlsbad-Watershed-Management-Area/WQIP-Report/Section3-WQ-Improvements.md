# Section 3: Water Quality Improvements

## Water Quality Improvement Goals, Schedules, and Strategies
This section summarizes the progress toward achieving the interim and final numeric goals and strategy implementation for the HPWQCs within the applicable HAs of the Carlsbad WMA during the reporting period. Identifying goals and the means to achieve them is a fundamental component of the WQIP. The goals, strategies, and schedules were established through the WQIP development process, and details are included in the current WQIP (September 2021).

The RAs implement strategies as part of their JRMPs and WQIP(s). A compilation of JRMP Annual Report data for FY22 is provided in Appendix C, demonstrating the collective efforts for jurisdictional implementation throughout the WMA. Thirteen strategies (i.e., core strategies) represent JRMP activities required by the MS4 permit, while other strategies have been identified to support progress toward WQIP goals. All strategies aim to protect, preserve, enhance, or restore water quality and designated beneficial uses of waterways within each HA. While some strategies focus on specific sources and stressors that potentially contribute to the HPWQC and PWQCs, others are more general and provide multiple water quality benefits. This multi-benefit approach is essential to maintaining and improving overall WMA health. These strategies and efforts are implemented on a regional, watershed, or jurisdictional scale, and implementation of these strategies during the reporting period is presented in Appendix D.

Over $17.9 million in RA program implementation expenditures were reported in FY22 to improve water quality within the Carlsbad WMA. This total expenditure includes funding for implementing over 70 strategies throughout the WMA, which contribute to improving or protecting water quality. The expenditures include jurisdictional program implementation, which, when combined as a watershed, resulted in the following outcomes2:

- 1,952 investigations of non-storm water discharges conducted
- 1,459 non-storm water discharges eliminated
- 1,299 illicit discharges/connections eliminated
- 7,615 construction site inspections
- 4,932 existing development inspections
- 3,017 tons of debris removed from MS4 structures and facilities
- 5,494 tons of debris removed through street sweeping efforts
- 1,617 high priority development structural BMP inspections
- 104 public outreach events conducted

The RAs also participated in several regional efforts to improve water quality in the Carlsbad WMA
(Appendix D). For example, RAs improved the Project Clean Water website to increase educational
resources, promoted the “52 Ways to Love Your Water” pledge to spread storm water awareness, and
sponsored several I Love a Clean San Diego clean-up events. Clean-up events resulted in the removal of
over 21,043 pounds of trash and recyclables in the Carlsbad WMA and approximately 76,980 pounds
region wide.

The following sub-sections present the upcoming interim and final goals and progress toward goals for each HA. Monitoring performed as part of the goal progress assessment is presented, and each sub-section concludes with strategy implementation highlights to address the respective HPWQC.

## 3.1 Loma Alta Hydrologic Area
The HPWQC for the Loma Alta HA3 (Figure 4) is eutrophic conditions in the Loma Alta Slough between May and October. The interim and final goals, progress toward those goals, and strategy highlights are presented in the following sub-sections.

**Figure 4: Loma Alta Hydrologic Area**

### 3.1.1 Goal Progress
The numeric goals for Loma Alta HA are based on macroalgal biomass (grams dry weight per cubic meter – g dw/m3) and macroalgal cover (percent cover) conditions in Loma Alta Slough from May through October. The interim and final goals to address HPWQCs in the Loma Alta HA and the progress toward goals are presented in Table 4.

Results from the Long-Term Water Quality Monitoring at Loma Alta Slough Monitoring Program (Weston Solutions, 2022) indicate that interim and final numeric goals have been achieved (Attachment 1). Furthermore, the 2022 results indicated both the lowest macroalgal biomass and percent cover in the entire monitoring program record. Biomass reductions have been ongoing since 2017 and have shown a statistically-significant decreasing trend. Figure 5 and Figure 6 compare results from the monitoring years 2016 through 2022 to interim and final goals. As shown, macroalgal cover and macroalgal biomass goals have been consistently met since 2016 and 2019, respectively. The 2022 summer monitoring period was the last year of monitoring required under Resolution No. R9-2014-0020, which required the Loma Alta Slough final numeric targets to be incorporated into the Carlsbad WQIP and for monitoring to be conducted from 2016-2022. As both final numeric goals have been met, and the monitoring period defined under the Resolution has terminated, the City of Oceanside anticipates negotiating the termination of this monitoring program with the RWQCB in early 2023. This effort may include a reevaluation of the HPWQC and other PWQCs for the Loma Alta HA per Section 4.6 of this annual report and procedures set forth in the current MS4 Permit.

**Figure 6: Loma Alta Slough Progress toward Macroalgal Biomass Goal**

### 3.1.2 Strategy Highlights
Strategies to highlight in the Loma Alta HA include the Loma Alta Slough Wetlands Enhancement Project and Garrison Creek Native Habitat Restoration Project strategies. Both strategies, discussed below, are restoration efforts aimed to achieve multiple benefits, including habitat enhancement, flood protection, water quality improvements, preservation of open space, and enhancing recreational opportunities. For additional strategies implemented in the HA during the reporting period, refer to Appendix D.
**Figure 7: Loma Alta Slough**

**Loma Alta Slough Wetland Enhancement Project**
The Loma Alta Slough Wetlands Enhancement is a multi-benefit habitat restoration project that (1) improves and expands coastal wetland habitat, (2) increases available open space for sensitive wildlife, and (3) improves water quality. Water quality improvements address the highest priority eutrophic water quality condition at Loma Alta Slough. The project is designed with climate change resiliency in mind to accommodate future sea-level rise and to protect adjacent coastal infrastructure. The project uses restoration techniques that are expected to improve water quality through natural processes, including increased assimilative capacity, residence time and natural wetland nutrient uptake and biotransformation. Furthermore, the project will provide recreational benefits to the community by including over 1,500 feet of new nature trails and pedestrian connections to nearby coastal transportation corridors.

During this WQIP reporting period, substantial progress was made in readying the project for construction. Additional funding was secured in early FY21-22 through a National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) grant to progress the engineering to 90%+ completion and finalize the permit applications, including city entitlement. In June 2022, the Ocean Protection Council awarded additional funding of over $1M for construction. The following was achieved in the FY21-22 reporting period:
- Advanced engineering design to a 90% design level;
- Completion of the CEQA process in addition to remaining special status species biological surveys for Tidewater Goby and Ridgway’s Rail
- Finalization of the project’s Habitat Restoration Plan; and,
- Revisions to the regulatory permit applications to incorporate the 90% design, finalizing the public trails alignments, and coordination with regulatory agencies to expedite the permitting process.

In January 2021, the city secured a $1M grant from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s National Coastal Wetlands Conservation grant for construction. The two construction grants are expected to be sufficient to build Phase 1 of the wetlands restoration project. The project is anticipated to secure the required permits in mid-2023, with construction expected in late 2023. The construction scheduled is entirely subject to the timeliness of permit approvals and the city entitlement process; therefore construction may occur in 2024.

**Figure 8: Loma Alta Slough Wetlands**

The city is coordinating the Enhancement Project construction with three important infrastructure projects in the vicinity of Loma Alta Slough, including the future decommissioning of the La Salina wastewater treatment plant, the Coastal Rail Trail extension southward over Loma Alta Creek, and future upgrades to Buccaneer Park. Completing these projects is synergistic as they will benefit one another by encouraging climate-friendly transit, restoring historical wetland habitats, and fostering public awareness of the value of open space creation and conservation.

**Garrison Creek Native Habitat Restoration Project**
In the reporting period, the City of Oceanside completed substantial work on the Garrison Creek Native Habitat Restoration Project. This project is a Supplemental Environmental Project (SEP), designed in cooperation with the RWQCB, to mitigate previous environmental impacts to the Loma Alta HA from a domestic sewage spill in 2015. The restoration work is intended to mitigate prior impacts to the Loma Alta tributary and enhance its biological and community value above its original condition. The project involves removing and controlling invasive vegetation within a 20-acre open space area of the Garrison Creek drainage and restoring over three acres of riparian forest and Diegan Coastal Sage Scrub habitat to benefit sensitive and threatened avian species. The project includes improvements to an existing public trail system with new interpretive signage to educate the community about the value of riparian habitat, restoration, and connectivity of watersheds and water quality in the Loma Alta HA.
**Figure 9: Garrison Creek Native Habitat Restoration Project**

During FY22, the city worked with its restoration partners, the Nature Collective and Friends of El Corazon, to conduct multiple invasive species treatments, installation of restoration irrigation, native plants, and broadcast seeding. The project is currently in Year 4 of the monitoring period and near achieving the success criteria for native habitat establishment and invasives control.

## 3.2 Agua Hedionda Hydrologic Area
The HPWQCs for the Agua Hedionda HA (Figure 11) are riparian habitat degradation and hydromodification impacts. The interim and final goals, progress toward those goals, and strategy highlights are presented in the following sub-sections.

**Figure 11: Agua Hedionda Hydrologic Area**

### 3.2.1 Goal Progress
In the Agua Hedionda HA, restoration projects have been identified as goals to address riparian habitat degradation and hydromodification impact HPWQCs. Restoration of riparian habitats and other natural features supports healthy watersheds by providing critical habitat for wildlife, reducing creek bank erosion, maintaining stable creek channel geomorphology, and enhancing natural processes to filter pollutants such as nutrients and sediment. In the Agua Hedionda HA, goal progress is based on advancing specific project implementation, as presented in Table 5.

**Table 5: Agua Hedionda HA Progress towards Interim and Final Numeric Goals**

### 3.2.2 Strategy Highlights
Strategies to highlight in the Agua Hedionda HA include the Roman Creek Wetland Restoration Project, Agua Hedionda Creek Restoration Project, and other efforts that address riparian habitat degradation and hydromodification impacts. For further details and additional strategies implemented in the HA during the reporting period, refer to Appendix D

**Agua Hedionda Creek Restoration Project**
The City of Carlsbad’s Agua Hedionda Creek Restoration Project focuses on restoring riparian habitat areas to improve flood control, reduce erosion, stabilize riverbanks, increase habitat connectivity and quality, and improve water quality.

The first interim goal (2018), to remove invasive species and restore wetland habitat in approximately 3.6 acres adjacent to a tributary of Agua Hedionda Creek (Lake Calavera Preserve) within the City of Carlsbad, was achieved in FY17. The city is in progress toward achieving the next interim goal (2023) and final goal (2028), as identified in Table 5. In FY22, the city completed its fifth year of required vegetation maintenance and monitoring efforts, including watering, non-native vegetation removal, and trash removal.

**Figure 12: Portion of Agua Hedionda Creek**
In FY22, the City of Carlsbad awarded a $1,919,294 contract to support the extension of College Boulevard to the east of El Camino Real at Sunny Creek Road. The extension of College Boulevard is a long-term project, and creek restoration is planned to be completed as part of the project. Tasks to be completed through the issued contract include, but are not limited to:

|                                                |                                                                                                                                  |
|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Land use review                                            | Preliminary civil engineering plans |
| Land surveying                                             | Preliminary storm water quality management plan |
| Preliminary environmental impact and mitigation assessment | Preliminary construction cost estimates |
| Preliminary hydraulic and hydrological studies             | Community outreach program to solicit input regarding the stakeholders’ concerns and goals for the new College Boulevard segment |
| Preliminary geotechnical engineering investigation         |  |

In FY22, the city completed the traffic mobility analysis, preliminary environmental field work and the preliminary hydraulics study.

While progress toward creek restoration has occurred, the city recognizes that achieving the 2023 interim and 2028 final restoration goals is in jeopardy. Under the city’s Growth Management Program, money from residential developer fees helps fund the infrastructure needed to support the corresponding increase in population. In the case of the College Boulevard extension, most of the adjacent properties don’t have active development plans, and not all landowners in the area are planning to develop soon, leading to a lack of funding and a delay of the overall project.

Knowing the Agua Hedionda Creek Restoration Project is delayed, and the final construction timeline is unknown at this time, the city summarized the project and program progress within the Agua Hedionda HA that has water quality similar benefits as creek restoration, see Attachment 2.

**Roman Creek Wetland Restoration Project**
Roman Creek resides in the southern portion of the city-owned Buena Vista Park and is tributary to Agua Hedionda Creek (Figure 13). Roman Creek has been identified as a strategy in the Carlsbad WMA WQIP for wetland creation and enhancement to address hydromodification impacts and as a mitigation strategy to compensate for aquatic resource impacts from other city projects. Previous Carlsbad WMA annual reports provide summaries of completed field studies, project design work, and environmental permitting activities for the project.

A request for proposals (RFP) was released on September 22, 2021, soliciting design-build services for the Roman Creek project, which is paid for from sewer funds. The RFP included a comprehensive scope of services to complete the project and achieve the WQIP numeric goals. Public bids were opened on October 22, 2021, and only one bid was received. The $6,000,000 bid was deemed responsive and responsible. However, the bid amount exceeded the project budget by over $2,300,000.

The city put the project on hold to consider value engineering and funding through its annual Capital Improvement Budget process in Spring 2022. Based on the capital project needs for overall sewer system capacity and replacement projects, sufficient funds were not available to close the Roman Creek project funding gap.

The city has expended a total of $1,136,000 on the project to date and is carrying-forward available budget for the project in the amount of $3,700,000. The project will be evaluated for additional funding and any schedule revisions reported in future WQIP annual reports.

**Figure 13: Roman Creek Wetland Restoration Project Location**

**Program for Stream, Channel, and/or Existing Habitat Rehabilitation in Areas of Existing Development**
Each RA developed rehabilitation programs as part of their jurisdictional programs to identify areas of streams, channels, and/or habitats that are candidates for rehabilitation and look for opportunities to implement projects. While all RAs implemented this program during FY22, the City of Carlsbad implemented a vegetation maintenance project in the Agua Hedionda HA to mitigate flooding impacts and protect riparian habitat.

**Agua Hedionda Creek Vegetation Maintenance Projec**
Within the City of Carlsbad, long-term maintenance of Agua Hedionda Creek between the Cannon Road and El Camino Real bridges is necessary to reduce flooding upstream. To improve the creek's flood capacity, limited vegetation is permitted within this portion of the creek. This project is a five-year project per the CDFW Streambed Alteration Agreement (SAA) Notification No. 1600-2013-0302-R5. The permit was extended through 2024, and associated work was performed in November 2021. Creek vegetation maintenance is vital to support optimal creek conveyance capacities and flood protection benefits. Vegetation maintenance removes obstructions from the channel, maximizing the flow potential and reducing the risk of flooding upstream.

## 3.3 San Marcos Hydrologic Area
The San Marcos HA has two distinct areas separated by the Lake San Marcos impoundment – the Upper San Marcos and Lower San Marcos HAs (Figure 14). The Lower and Upper San Marcos HAs have different HPWQCs. The HPWQCs, interim and final goals, progress toward those goals, and strategy highlights for the Upper San Marcos HA and Lower San Marcos HA are presented in Section 3.3.1 and 3.3.2, respectively.
