# Section 6: Conclusion
## Conclusions
RAs successfully implemented the WQIP during the reporting period through collaborative and proactive
efforts on the regional, watershed, and jurisdictional levels. Successful programmatic and water quality
outcomes achieved in FY23 helped to protect, preserve, enhance, and restore water quality and
designated beneficial uses of waterways within the WMA. Through these efforts many interim goals were 
achieved and significant progress towards final numeric goals were achieved.

The RAs will continue to implement strategies and make program adjustments to maintain progress in
achieving interim and final goals. In FY24, several RAs will be continuing adaptive management processes 
to evaluate HPWQCs and numeric goals in several HAs. These RAs will coordinate with RWQCB staff and 
provide rationale and updated numeric goals to the RWQCB for approval before implementation. 

Dry and wet weather MS4 outfall monitoring for the 2022-2023 monitoring year provided data and
information regarding MS4 water quality conditions (see Attachment 3). During the reporting period, 810
dry weather MS4 visual observations were performed, and a total of 33% of the 483 major MS4 outfalls
were classified as dry (i.e., dry for three consecutive site visits).

During dry weather sampling, all results for the dissolved fractions of hexavalent chromium, trivalent 
chromium, iron, lead, silver, and zinc were below the NAL in 100% of the analytical samples. During wet
weather outfall sampling, 75% of the results met applicable action levels. Parameters below SALs include
total cadmium, total copper, total lead, total zinc, and turbidity.

During FY23, RAs collaborated to implement the WQIP and address commentsfrom the RWQCB. A revised
WQIP was submitted in September 2021 and accepted by the RWQCB in December 2021. The RAs are
committed to continuing JRMP and WQIP implementation in FY24 and working collaboratively to improve
water quality throughout the Carlsbad WMA.

As the MS4 Permit reissuance continues, it is recommended that the CWMA RAs continue their history of 
engagement with RWQCB staff and in the region to work towards streamlined reporting efforts and 
meaningful program planning, implementation, and reporting.
